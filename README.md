# 🛠️ AI Agents, Memory, and Model Prompt Parser 🧠

Welcome to the **AI Agents Repository**! This project demonstrates the concepts of **Agents**, **Memory**, and the **Model Prompt Parser**. Each of these components is explained and implemented using interactive Jupyter notebooks to help you build smarter, context-aware AI systems.

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository contains three key Jupyter notebooks:

```bash
├── 1_Agents.ipynb          # Demonstrates AI Agent logic and functions
├── 2_Memory.ipynb          # Explains how AI agents can use memory
├── 3_Model_Prompt_Parser.ipynb  # Shows how to parse dynamic prompts for AI models
└── README.md               
```


## 🚀 Key Concepts

### 1. **Agents 🤖**
AI Agents are autonomous entities that can perform tasks based on given goals or instructions. They:

- **Make Decisions**: Using inputs from the environment or user.
- **Automate Tasks**: Handle tasks or processes without continuous human input.
- **Learn**: Adapt and improve their actions over time.

In the **`1_Agents.ipynb`** notebook, you will find:
- How to define an AI agent.
- How the agent can perform tasks and interact with its environment.

### 2. **Memory 🧠**
Memory allows AI agents to retain context across multiple interactions, improving the quality of responses by "remembering" important details.

Memory in AI can be:
- **Short-Term Memory**: For storing temporary, session-based information.
- **Long-Term Memory**: For more persistent, reusable data.

In the **`2_Memory.ipynb`** notebook, we cover:
- How memory can be implemented in AI agents.
- Examples of short-term and long-term memory for AI agents.

### 3. **Model Prompt Parser 📜**
A **Model Prompt Parser** helps convert user inputs into structured prompts for the AI model to process efficiently. It allows dynamic and flexible interactions with the AI.

In the **`3_Model_Prompt_Parser.ipynb`** notebook, you'll learn:
- How to parse raw user inputs.
- How to build effective prompts for language models to ensure accurate responses.
